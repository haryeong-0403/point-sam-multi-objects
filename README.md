<h2>3D Segmentation Multi Object with Point-SAM</h2>

This repository contains a customized pipeline for fully automatic 3D instance segmentation using **Point-SAM**, applied to real-world point clouds (e.g., from BLK360). 
The goal is to extract object-level masks without any manual prompts.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

- Automatically generate instance masks from raw 3D point clouds using Point-SAM
- Eliminate the need for manual clicks or annotations
- Enable object-level segmentation for downstream 3D scene understanding
